Modifications in Prefetcher
After downloading the ChampSim repository, I ave added and modified a few files in the /inc/ and /prefetcher/ folders, which I have uploaded in the repo. 
You can see new files named spp_design1/2/3 which contains the 3 designs that we wanted to test. TO see the code modifications in prefetchers (.l2c_pref files), 
search for 'chirayu code modifications'.

I have addded a few .sh and .py scripts for running the simulations and for extracting the data into excel files, the codes are easy to undersatnd.
